I am a Data and Business Intelligence Analyst from Munich, Germany and have lived in the UK and the US for most of my professional life. I am fluent in German, French and English.

I have experiences in the Tourism Industry, Fintech and Healthtech and am now looking for my next challenge.

On this page I will try to show you the type of tools I am familiar with and examples of the type of work I have completed.

Outside of my professional life my passions lie in Personal Finance, NFL and Indoor Bouldering.
