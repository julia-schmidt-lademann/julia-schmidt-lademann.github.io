I have extensive experience in Tableau.

In my previous roles I was responsible for the client reporting. This includes
- creating the report from scratch, building a story, deploying it to the client and training the client in using the report
- Maintenance of the data following product or commercial changes.
- Tracking of performance during product testing and trialing.  


Examples of tableua features I have worked with include:
- Calculated fields
- Parameters
- Window Functions
- Sets
- Leveraging Default Properties
- Using sheets as filters
- Using Parameters to change which visuals are shown
- Using dashboard Actions
- Using dynamic labels
- Using sheets in tooltips
- Using dynamic triangles when reporting on preiod-over-period change
- Row level permissions
