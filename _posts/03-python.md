My education in Python has been self-taught. It includes online courses like:

Data Science: Python for Data Analysis 2022 Full Bootcamp by Udemy, completed in October 2022
Python and Flask Bootcamp: Create Websites using Flask! by Udemy, completed in April 2021
I annually take part in Advent of code.

I use Python in my personal projects for example when analysing Best Ball data.
