**Background:**
- The Go To Market team has asked for a report to help them target new clients based on their Growth and Revenue/Expense ratio. 

**Dashboard:**
- The Dashboard shows a Scatterplot of each company's Expense and Revenues. Low expenses and high revenue is shown in the top right corner. 
- The Dashboard also shows the Companies with the highest percentage growth using colors and in a list.
- The Tooltip allows the user to easily identify the Name, Industry, and other Attributes associated with each Datapoint.

**Functionalities:**
- The Dashboard allows the user to dynamically set the Expense and revenue cutoff and narrow down the share of the market they are interested in. This selection will change the Reference lines and marks highlighted.
- The User also can choose dynamically how many companies should be highlighted for having the highest growth changing the shape and color of those companies. 

**Technical Details:**
- Using dynamic sets driven by parameters allows the internal customers to drive insights in a self-serve manner.
- Using sheets as filters can allow lists and graphs to easily interact and speed up the user's path to Action.
