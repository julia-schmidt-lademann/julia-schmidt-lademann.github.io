#### Instrutions:
- This was a simple example exercise using fictitious tables to demonstrate how we could analyze marketing attribution to different marketing channels. 
- Create a python script that attributes the registration to a given marketing channel, based on the “Last Sent” attribution model. The time windows that we have for each marketing channel are the following ones:
  - 30 days for Direct Mail. 
  - 3 days for SMS, both acquisition and CRM. 
  - 3 days for Email, both acquisition and CRM.
- For this exercise you can assume that Tables A, B, and C are Pandas dataframes.
  - Assuming a table A containing members events, and the dates when they gained eligibility, lost eligibility and when they signed up.
  - Assuming a table B containing marketing outreach completed to the different members, and the dates of the outreach attempts.

#### Process:
- Working entirely in Pandas I merged the DataFrames based on the last marketing interaction completed wth this member.
- I added a calculated field to determine which interactions fall into the mentioned timeframes.
- Finally I created the results table that show the number of members signed up through each campaign.

- Using a Kaggle Dataset I wanted to investigate what would be the impact on the final league standings if the points were given out differently
  - One example would be if the points were given based on the halftime score
  - Another would be if the points in the last week,like in Formula One, the points were doubled
## Findings
- Double points on the last day have little impact. Only one season since 1995 would have seen an impact of this.
- Counting scores as half time has a much larger impact
  - The resulting League Winner would have changed in 8 Seasons out of the 23 analyzed. 
  - Chelsea was the most frequently impacted team, and would have gained as many as 5 places.
