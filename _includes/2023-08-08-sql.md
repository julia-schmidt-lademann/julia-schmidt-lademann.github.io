##SQL Experience


I have experience using SQL to transform raw kafka events data into clean and easily readable tables including business logic and the required documentation.

In my past role I was solely responsible for a data domain meaning:
- keeping up with product changes and implementing relevant changes in the domain
- investigating data issues and working with the relevant upstream teams to investigate fixes and review the processes
- delivering analysis on the processes 


Examples of SQL features I have worked with include:
- Aggregations
- Subqueries
- Joins
- Boolean fields
- Temp tables
- Date functions
- Using Arrays as spines
- Safe_divide
- Type Casting
- Filling in null values
- Rank and Row Number functions
- Lag and Lead functions
- Hashing of data for Privacy reasons
