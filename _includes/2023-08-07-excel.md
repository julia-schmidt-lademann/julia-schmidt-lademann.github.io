##Excel Experience


I have advanced experience in Excel including Formulas, Pivots, Visualizations and VBA Macros.

I enjoy following the Microsoft Excel World Championship, and try to complete the challenges myself. 

In my private life I have built a budgeting spreadsheet allowing for balancing the books, allocating funds to categories and reporting on spending and allocation in many different formats.
