## Flask Website Showcase

**Background:**
- After completing an online course on Python and Flask I wanted to put my learnings into practice.  
- The course taught using case studies how to build a website using flask, including user management, creating new pages and 

**Professional use:**
- I was able to use these learnings in a professional setting.
- The challenge posed to me was that based on the industry, contract type and product a data contract should be created stating which metrics we are able to deliver to the client.
- The build involved processing data ingested from Bigquery and gsheets based on user input and then creating a PDF file using the available information that the user can download.
- The product was fully functional and available, unfortunately there was no support for hosting the website that would have allowed this to go into production.

**Learnings:**
- Due to the setup on my machine I struggle a lot with CSS and the frontend layout of websites. 
- The Flask terms were very intuitive allowing for an intricate setup using easy to follow logic
