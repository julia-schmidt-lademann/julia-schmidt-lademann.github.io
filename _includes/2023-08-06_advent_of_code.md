**What is Advent of Code**: 
- Advent of Code is a competition running between the 1st and 25th of december every year created by Eric Wastl. 
- Every day a new puzzle is revealed which grants 1 star for solving Part 1, and another star for solving a related Part 2 of the puzzle for a total 50 stars for the year.
- Past year's puzzles are available and can still be completed.
- All puzzles are built so that theoretically they be solved with just logic and Pen and Paper.

**Why do I enjoy Advent of Code**:
- I initially started AoC as a friendly competition and in the first year tried to complete all puzzles in Excel/VBA. 
- Seeing the challenges I ran into it clearly showed 
- Every puzzle challenges a different aspect and requires the processing of data in very different formats, which had a lot of application in the real world
- The split between part 1 and 2 encourages users to build solutions that can be easily adapted and are not too rigid. This too is very applicable in the real world.
