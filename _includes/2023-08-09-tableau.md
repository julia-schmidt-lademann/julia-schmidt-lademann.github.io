I have extensive knowledge of Tableau.

In my previous roles I was responsible for the client reporting. This includes
- Creating the contractual reporting from scratch, building a story, deploying it to the client and training the client in using the report
- Maintenance of the data following product or commercial changes.
- Tracking of performance during product testing and trialing.  

Examples of tableau features I have worked with include:
- Calculated fields
- Parameters
- Window Functions
- Sets
- Leveraging Default Properties
- Using sheets as filters
- Using Parameters to change which visuals are shown
- Using dashboard Actions
- Using dynamic labels
